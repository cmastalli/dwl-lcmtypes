// This message describes the reduced trajectory of rigid body system.
//
// A reduced trajectory is defined by a sequence of reduced states.
// A reduced state is defined by the center of mass (CoM) position,
// center of pressure (CoP), or zero moment point (ZMP), position
// and the support polygon for each phase.
// The description of every element is defined in their respective
// messages.
//
// This message consists of a multiple arrays, one for each part of
// of the reduced-body state.
//
// The utime specifies the time at which the trajectory is published.
